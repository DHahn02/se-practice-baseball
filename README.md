This software will help managers determine which players to put on the roster
and which players to promote and demote from the different leagues. 

    The managers can look through their players and see how well they 
    are playing based on their stats (hits, batting average, etc.)
    and see if a player should be promoted to a higher league or if
    he should be demoted to a lower league.
    
    It will show the optimal lineup for each team based on their stats, 
    taking recency into account (taking the opposing pitcher into account,
    if we have time).
    
    This software will give the managers data which will help to calculate
    what to do with their players. The manager will have a few different
    options for what how he can use the system. He can search an individual
    player if he wants to see their stats, he can look at a list of players 
    whose stats deem them to be promoted or a list of players whose stats
    deem them to be demoted, and choose to promote/demote them. He can also
    see a list of the most optimal lineup for each team, i.e. the players 
    in each league with the highest stats for their position.
    
    The manager can add the stats for a specified player based on the 
    at bat and its result.
